# Cpp Module 06 - C++ casts

## Description:
**This Module is about the different types of casting (conversion) for the
built-in C++ datatypes**

## Instructions:
***to build and test the module contents:***
```bash

    # cd into the directory of the exercise
    cd exN #<Number-Of-Ex>

    # Compile and  build
    make all

    # Run
    ./<Executable-Name>

    # You can also add more tests in the main.c file
```
